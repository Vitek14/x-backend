# Twitter Clone Backend

## Overview

This repository contains the backend component for the **Twitter Clone** project - a learning-focused effort to replicate core Twitter/X functionality. The backend serves as the API layer and database manager for the [frontend application](https://github.com/Vitek14/twitter), which is built with Vite + React.

### Key Technologies
- **Node.js** (v20+ recommended)
- **Express** framework for REST API
- **Sequelize** ORM for PostgreSQL
- **JWT** for authentication
- **PostgreSQL** database

### Core Features
- RESTful API endpoints for tweet/user operations
- Authentication system with JWT tokens
- Database structure management via migrations
- Seeders for initial test data
- Environment-based configuration
- Model relationships (Users, Tweets, Follows, Likes)

This backend is designed to work in tandem with the [frontend repository](https://github.com/Vitek14/twitter). For full functionality, both components must be running simultaneously.
